                                  <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern the access or use by you, an individual, from within the United States and its territories and possessions of applications, websites, content, products, and services (the "Services") made available in the United States and its territories and possessions by Qudos USA LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Qudos"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES. In these Terms, the words "including" and "include" mean "including, but not limited to."</p>
                                  <p>Your access and use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which establishes a contractual relationship between you and Qudos. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. Qudos may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.</p>
                                  <p>Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in region-specific disclosures (e.g., a particular city webpage on www.driveQudos.com) or in connection with the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.</p>
                                  <p>Qudos may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon Qudos's posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service(s). Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.</p>
                                  <p>Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the Services is as provided in Qudos's Privacy Policy located on the website at www.driveQudos.com.</p>

                                  <p>The Services constitute a technology platform that enables users of Qudos's mobile applications or websites provided as part of the Services (each, an "Application") to arrange and schedule transportation and/or logistics services with third party providers of such services, including independent third party transportation providers and third party logistics providers under agreement with Qudos or certain of Qudos's affiliates ("Third Party Providers"). Unless otherwise agreed by Qudos in a separate written agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT QUDOS DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION OR LOGISTICS SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER.</p>
                                  <p>License.</p>
                                  <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Qudos grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferrable license to: (i) access and use the Applications on your personal device solely in connection with your use of the Services; and (ii) access and use any content, information and related materials that may be made available through the Services, in each case solely for your personal, noncommercial use.

                                  <p>Provision of the Services.</p>
                                  <p>You acknowledge that portions of the Services may be made available under Qudos's various brands or request options associated with transportation or logistics. You also acknowledge that the Services may be made available under such brands or request options by or in connection with: (i) certain of Qudos's subsidiaries and affiliates; or (ii) independent Third Party Providers, including Transportation Network Company drivers, Transportation Charter Permit holders or holders of similar transportation permits, authorizations or licenses.</p>
                                  <p>Third Party Services and Content.</p>
                                  <p>The Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third party services and content (including advertising) that Qudos does not control. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your use of such third party services and content. Qudos does not endorse such third party services and content and in no event shall Qudos be responsible or liable for any products or services of such third party providers. Additionally, Apple Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft Corporation or BlackBerry Limited will be a third-party beneficiary to this contract if you access the Services using Applications developed for Apple iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, or Blackberry-powered mobile devices, respectively. These third party beneficiaries are not parties to this contract and are not responsible for the provision or support of the Services in any manner. Your access to the Services using these devices is subject to terms set forth in the applicable third party beneficiary's terms of service.</p>
                                  <p>Ownership.</p>
                                  <p>The Services and all rights therein are and shall remain Qudos's property or the property of Qudos's licensors.

                                  <p>License.</p>
                                  <p>In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account ("Account"). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to submit to Qudos certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or Qudos's termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Qudos in writing, you may only possess one Account.</p>
                                  <p>User Requirements and Conduct.</p>
                                  <p>The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive transportation or logistics services from Third Party Providers unless they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes (e.g., no transport of unlawful or hazardous materials). You will not in your use of the Services cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party. In certain instances you may be asked to provide proof of identity to access or use the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of the Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity.</p>
                                  <p>Text Messaging.</p>
                                  <p>By creating an Account, you agree that the Services may send you informational text (SMS) messages as part of the normal business operation of your use of the Services. You may opt-out of receiving text (SMS) messages from Qudos at any time by texting the word STOP in reply to the text message from the mobile device receiving the messages. You acknowledge that opting out of receiving text (SMS) messages may impact your use of the Services.</p>
                                  <p>Promotional Codes.</p>
                                  <p>Qudos may, in Qudos's sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Third Party Provider's services, subject to any additional terms that Qudos establishes on a per promotional code basis ("Promo Codes"). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Qudos; (iii) may be disabled by Qudos at any time for any reason without liability to Qudos; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Qudos establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Qudos reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that Qudos determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.</p>
                                  <p>User Provided Content.</p>
                                  <p>Qudos may, in Qudos's sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to Qudos through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions ("User Content"). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to Qudos, you grant Qudos a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Qudos's business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.</p>
                                  <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Qudos the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor Qudos's use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
                                  <p>You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Qudos in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. Qudos may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at Qudos's sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.</p>
                                  <p>Network Access and Devices.</p>
                                  <p>You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. Qudos does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.</p>

                                  <h5>4. Payment</h5>
                                  <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider ("Charges"). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Qudos will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Qudos. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Qudos will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.</p>
                                  <p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Qudos using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Qudos will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Qudos may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
                                  <p>As between you and Qudos, Qudos reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Qudos's sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Qudos will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Qudos may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.</p>
                                  <p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Qudos does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Qudos (on Qudos's website, in the Application, or in Qudos's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Qudos provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive transportation or logistics services from Third Party Providers unless they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes (e.g., no transport of unlawful or hazardous materials). You will not in your use of the Services cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party.

                                  <h5>6. Dispute Resolution</h5>
                                  <p>Arbitration.</p>
                                  <p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Qudos, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Qudos are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Qudos otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
                                  <p>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</p>
                                  <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_medor by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
                                  <p>Arbitration Process.</p>
                                  <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration atwww.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
                                  <p>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</p>
                                  <p>Unless you and Qudos otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Qudos submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
                                  <p>Arbitrator's Decision.</p>
                                  <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Qudos will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Qudos may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if Qudos prevail in arbitration.</p>
                                  <p>Fees.</p>
                                  <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Qudos will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
                                  <p>Changes.</p>
                                  <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Qudos changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Qudos written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Qudos USA LLC, Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 1969 Steinway Street, Logn Island City, NY 11105, or by email from the email address associated with your Account to: support@driveQudos.com, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last update" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Qudos in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

                                  <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in supplemental terms applicable to your region.</p>

                                  <p>Notice.</p>
                                  <p>Qudos may give notice by means of a general notice on the Services, electronic mail to your email address in your Account, or by written communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to your address in your Account.

                                  <p>You may not assign these Terms without Qudos's prior written approval.
